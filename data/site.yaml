        I'm a veteran software engineer with over a decade of experience, skilled
        in PHP, Golang, and Python. I have a passion for writing code as cleanly
        and efficiently as possible and I'm always looking for new and interesting
        problems to solve through code!

            the various courses. It was built using a system inspired by the logic engine that powers
            the OncoLife Survivorship Care Plan.

            Application writen in Go for provisioning apps with Docker based on Platform.sh's
            .platform.app.yaml file. This has been superseded by a new tool called Pbrew
            that removes the need for Docker and instead uses Homebrew to manage services.

            A simple endless runner where you avoid obstacles and collect coins. A simple
            game that is easy to code that I often rewrite to test new langauges and
            engines. There was also a version created on an [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/).

            A 2.5D dungeon crawler that was to feature a custom character creator, online
            multiplayer, and lots of equipable items. While this project was never completed 
            it's a interesting look in to my early years as a developer and game 
            esigner. This was also built with [Panda 3D](https://www.panda3d.org/).

            Over the years I've tried many times to create a cooperative side scroller
            dungeon crawler game. While I've never quite seen it through to completion
            every attempt is always a very interesting and fun exercise. I've rebuilt the
            same prototype probably at least half a dozen times in a variety of languages
            and game engines, including engines I built myself.
