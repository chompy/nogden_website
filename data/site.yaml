    about: |
        I have been professional developer since 2007 and have worked on a variety of projects. My
        passion for programming comes from a desire to make video games, something I often do in my
        free time. I'm always looking for new and interesting problems to solve through code!

            A 2.5D dungeon crawler that was to feature a custom character creator, online
            multiplayer, and lots of equipable items. While this project was never completed 
            it's a interesting look in to my early years as a developer and game 
            esigner. This was also built with [Panda 3D](https://www.panda3d.org/).

            Over the years I've tried many times to create a cooperative side scroller
            dungeon crawler game. While I've never quite seen it through to completion
            every attempt is always a very interesting and fun exercise. Over the years
            I've rebuilt the same prototype probably at least half a dozen times in a
            variety of languages and game engines, including engines I built myself.
